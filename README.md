* Credits  to all the valid owners, i'm just an person who's revamping _`infinite yield`_


  ## ` Q: WHY ARE YOU MAKING A REVAMP? `
  * A: To make the enjoyement 10/10 and always useful at times, and `to increase reputation;`
  * Add more commands, update old things, add more commands `to fill out the empty;`
  ## ` Q: How to auto-update? `
  * A: You can easily `auto-update` by using the `loadstring` method;
